Provides a default implementation of the RV commands used in initializing and
communicating over an encrypted IM session via the protocol created by the
developers of <a href="http://trillian.cc" title="The website of the Trillian
IM client">Trillian</a>, an IM client for Windows.
<br>
<br>
Note that as of this writing, it is unknown how exactly the sessions are
encrypted; while the Trillian website claims the encryption is Blowfish with a
key negotiated using the Diffie-Hellman system, the actual data that is
transferred between clients does not satisfy the requirements of a traditional
Diffie-Hellman exchange. Watch this space.
