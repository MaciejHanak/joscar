--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

joscar includes a build.xml file for use with the Apache Project's ant build
utility.  For instructions on using ant, please see the ant web site
(http://ant.apache.org/).

The following targets are defined in build.xml:

   - joscar:  Builds joscar binaries.

   - jar:  Builds a jar file containing (only) joscar binaries.

   - test:  Builds and runs JUnit tests in tests/.

   - demo:  Builds JoscarTester binaries and places them in demo/.

   - run-demo:  Builds the JoscarTester demo and runs it.

   - javadoc:  Generates HTML documentation from the joscar source.

   - clean:  Cleans binaries, documentation, demo, and other "junk" from the
     tree. Note that this target deletes several directories and should be 
     used with caution.


In addition, the following targets are available for producing a distribution
release directory:

   - dist-src:  Copies the Java source files in the source directory to
     joscar-<version>/src.

   - dist-doc:  Copies all files in the docs/ directory to
     joscar-<version>/docs/.

   - dist-package:  Creates tar/gz, tar/bz2, and zip files with the contents 
     of joscar-<version>/.

   - dist:  Deletes any previous joscar-<version> directory, then performs the
     above three steps.

   - dist-clean:  Deletes joscar-<version>/ and any packaged zip/tar files
     with the same name.
