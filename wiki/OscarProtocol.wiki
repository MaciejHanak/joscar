The OSCAR protocol is the protocol used to communicate over the [http://www.aim.com AOL Instant Messenger] (AIM) service. OSCAR is a closed and proprietary protocol as far as AOL is concerned; the company refuses to release documentation or sample code for using OSCAR. (There is another protocol used to connect to AIM called TOC, but it is no longer used by most programs because it does not support as many features as OSCAR.)

Many AIM programs (also known as AIM clients) use OSCAR, including [http://www.aim.com/download.adp AOL's own clients], Apple's [http://www.apple.com/ichat/ iChat], [http://icq.com/ ICQ], and many "unauthorized" clients such as [http://fire.sourceforge.net/ Fire], [http://gaim.sourceforge.net gaim], [http://adium.sourceforge.net Adium (for Mac OS X)], and [http://trillian.cc/ Trillian].
