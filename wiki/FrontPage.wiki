== The OSCAR protocol documentation project ==
This is the OSCAR documentation project, where KeithLea, DavidWalluck, and [Hoov] (and anyone else who wants to ContributeToOscarDocWiki) plan to write an extensive set of documentation for using AOL Instant Messenger's OSCAR protocol (also known as AIM/OSCAR). There are a set of OscarDocWikiStandards that are followed in this wiki.

'''UPDATE Dec 2003'''
 I (KeithLea) have been busy with other projects and school lately, and have not had time to document many aspects of the protocol. A few big parts that are done are pretty complete, though: AimSecureIm, InitialAuthentication, and LoggingIn.

 As always, anyone who wants to contribute, even if you don't know too much about the protocol, should feel free to start working on any of the pages that don't exist (or if you want to, adding to pages that already do exist).
