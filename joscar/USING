THE JOSCAR LIBRARY

The joscar library is heavily documented.  Every single class, method, and
field is fully documented, and developers working with the library are urged to
read through and understand the documentation of any and all classes he is
using.  You can find the documentation in the docs/api/ directory of this 
distribution, or on the Joust Project web site 
(http://joust.kano.net/joscar/docs/api/).

JOSCARTESTER

joscar is a rather complicated library, and may be intimidating to users new
to either the library, the protocol, or even the Java language itself.
Luckily, a "demo" called JoscarTester is included with this library.  While
JoscarTester is by no means a well-designed, high-quality implementation of a
joscar-based application, it can be a starting point for implementing your
own applications using joscar.  JoscarTester (and its numerous related classes)
is located in the source directory; the classes exist in their entirety in the
net.kano.joscartests package.  To run JoscarTester, simply run 'java
net.kano.joscartests.JoscarTester <screenname> <password>' and it will attempt
to log into AOL Instant Messenger with the given screenname.  It has a simple
command-line interface that may be explained here later; scroll to near the
bottom of JoscarTester.java for the two lists of commands.  (NOTE that the
joscartests package is not included in the given .jar file.  It must be
compiled from source!)

Note that some somewhat messy classpath hacking will probably be necessary to
run JoscarTester. Try something like this in your home joscar direcory:

    java -cp bin:demo net.kano.joscartests.JoscarTester <username> <password>
